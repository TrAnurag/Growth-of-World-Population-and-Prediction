# Growth-of-World-Population-and-Prediction
In this project, we took into consideration multiple factors that influences population growth either positively or negative, factors such as mortality rates, fertility rates, migration patterns, natural chances and GDP.
These factors were carefully analyzed and virtualized to have a clear view on the level positive or negative impact they have on population dynamic and projections to provide a holistic understanding of global population trends



Data Dictionary:
Mortality:   Rate at which people die represented in numerical value

Fertility rate:   The rate at which people put to birth represented in numerical values.

Natural changes:   Birth minus Death represented in numerical values.

Year:   year the data was gotten, year of projection which is from 1950 to 2100 

Region:  Region in the world, and the data set has 6, Africa, North America, Asian, Europe, Oceania and the South America

SDG Regions(Sustainable Devleopment Goals):  Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa and Western Asia, Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South Eastern Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Oceania, Australia/New Zealand, Europe and Northern America.



Problem Statement:

How will the global demographics change in the next decades?
What is the influence of Migration on Population?
What is the mortality rates of the population?
What are the veers of Death rates of males and females around the globe?
How does fertility rate is affected?
What is the effect of Natural changes on the population?
